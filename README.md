# DATA-SCIENCE-USING-NUMPY
# Welcome to the "Data Science with NumPy" repository! This repository contains a collection of resources, tutorials, and examples demonstrating how to perform data science tasks using NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library in Python.

# Introduction
NumPy (Numerical Python) is an essential library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large number of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. This repository aims to showcase how NumPy can be leveraged for various data science tasks, including data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning preprocessing.

# Features
